#### Riu Sante Fe Resort
The Riu Sante Fe is an all-inclusive resort located in Cabo, San Lucas, Mexico. 
Staying ~~four~~ five nights, Sante Fe accommodated to all of of our needs for the week
to ensure we enjoyed our stay. I would recommend the resort to anyone planning
a trip to Cabo. More information can be found [here](https://www.riu.com/en/hotel/mexico/los-cabos/hotel-riu-santa-fe/)
